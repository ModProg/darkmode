# darkmode


This crate currently only supports Linux. Though I'm not opposed to add
other platforms. It uses the
[XDG Desktop Portal Settings](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/doc-org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.html#org-freedesktop-portal-settings-settingchanged).
It is intended as a minimal crate to be used on top of `winit`'s built-in
dark mode detection on other OSes.
